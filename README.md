Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a master's student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying for the Business: Data, Insights, and Analytics degree. 

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from Missouri State University and almost ten years of experience working in software quality assurance automation. 

I plan on adding examples of my analytics work here.  Thank you for taking a look around!
