This is work I performed in a Jupyter Notebook file in a scenario where I was a sales analyst for the fictional company RUSH Sportswear.

RUSH stores raw data in a collection of three tables: TABLE_PRODUCTS, TABLE_RETAILER, and TABLE_SALES. CSV files containing data for each table are included in this folder, and were used to answer the following business questions asked by the VP of Sales:

* What product category (product) had the highest sales (in dollars) in 2021? How much did it sell?
* What state had the highest sales (in dollars) of women's products in 2021? How much was it?
* What state had the highest sales (in dollars) of men's products in 2021? How much was it?
* What retailer purchased the most units in 2021? In 2020?

I was also asked to analyze sales data for trends and insights that will help company leadership understand the market and identify opportunities for growth, and to make a 3 to 5 minute presentation to answer the questions and provide my analysis findings.
