In this subfolder, you will find:
- A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for a reinsurance portfolio optimizer
- A PowerPoint running down the key information about the model and what the model found

I used Pyomo for the model. Pyomo is an open source Python library used for creating and running optimization models.
