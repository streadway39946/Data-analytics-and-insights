In this subfolder, you will find:
- A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for a reinsurance portfolio optimizer
- A PowerPoint running down the key information about the model and what the model found

I used Pyomo for the model. Pyomo is an open source Python library used for creating and running optimization models.

This model allocates reinsurance coverage across various risk categories to minimize expected losses, stay within budget, meet regulatory capital requirements, and maximize coverage efficiency.
