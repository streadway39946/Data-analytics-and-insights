The analytics work in this folder was performed for Urban Hamster's customer service department, who had the following questions:

Which categories have the highest return rates?
  In particular, does Urban Hamster's new line of eco-friendly outerwear have a high return rate, or are the return rates between categories more       spread out/even?
    
Are Urban Hamster's policy terms too strict? Too lenient?
  How do their policy terms compare to the industry standard?
  The team noted the policy terms had not been updated in some time.
        
What impact do returns have on Urban Hamster's bottom line?
    
What impact do returns have on customer satisfaction and Urban Hamster's brand overall?
