The analytics work in this folder was performed for Urban Hamster's customer service department, who had the following questions:

Which categories have the highest return rates?
  In particular, does Urban Hamster's new line of eco-friendly outerwear have a high return rate, or are the return rates between categories more       spread out/even?
    
Are Urban Hamster's policy terms too strict? Too lenient?
  How do their policy terms compare to the industry standard?
  The team noted the policy terms had not been updated in some time.
        
What impact do returns have on Urban Hamster's bottom line?
    
What impact do returns have on customer satisfaction and Urban Hamster's brand overall?

What can Urban Hamster do about the previous two questions?


Description of files and links in this folder:

- Hamster Database Setup.sql - .sql ran in Snowflake to create the Hamster database, which supplied the data for the insights
- Queries to Answer Business Questions.sql - The queries run over the Hamster database to find answers for the questions asked by the customer service team. A note: not all of their questions could be answered using .sql, so I answered those questions using comment blocks.
- Urban Hamster Return Policy.pdf - Some of the questions the customer service team asked were around Urban Hamster's return policy and how they compared to policies for other clothing retailers. I thought it would be helpful to provide a copy of the return policy for reference.
- [Video Presentation - Answering the Business Questions](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cThOcGn6uyM) - I recorded this video, just under 3 minutes long, to present my answers for the business questions.
- [Tableau Public Dashboard for Requested Insights for Urban Hamster Customer Service Team](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel.treadway/viz/RequestedInsightsforUrbanHamsterCustomerServiceTeam/UrbanHamsterDashboard) - After answering the questions the customer service team had for me, they requested I create this Tableau dashboard to display a set of charts with different order-related data.
- [Video Presentation - A Rundown of the Tableau Dashboard](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cT1nYBn6s1P) - This is a ~2 minte video where I describe the charts in the Tableau dashboard and how I met the customer service team requests for the visualization.
